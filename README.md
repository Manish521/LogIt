LogIt is an attempt to help provide the Chicago freelancer crime journalist community a
platform where they can view and cover the incidents that have occurred to Chicago residents.
Upon covering the incident and preparing a report they can close the incident marking it
complete.

A regular user, who has suffered any kind of incident can create an incident for the reporters to
cover. Thereby, helping the community.

If you are a Regular user, please sign up to log an incident.
While logging in the incident, you will have the option to describe the incident and also upload
relevant file(s).
You will also be able to see all your logged incidents under 'All Incidents' categorized on the
basis of their status.

If you are a Journalist, please sign up to view the incidents you can cover.
While signing up, you will be asked your preferred zip code and incidents occurred in this
locality will be highlighted for you.
You can view an incident and can choose to cover it.
Post covering, you can close the incident and mark it complete or you can also leave the
incident and make it available for other reporters.
Additionally, you can also log incidents that might have occurred with you.
Note: You cannot cover incidents occurred to you.

A major focus has been kept on keeping the user posting the incident completely safe, thus
preventing him from spam.

LogIt is taking a step forward to help the community and will be continuously moderated for
bad content. However, we are not responsible for any incorrect information posted on this site.
